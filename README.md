Skelly Board is barebones message board, created for a coding test. It's still a bit rought around the edges,
but the basic functionality is there!

It's still under development, so check in once in a while to see what's changed.

Also, give it a moment to load. The dynos are sleeping, and take a moment to spin up!

The project can be accessed at [SkellyBoard](https://skellyboard.herokuapp.com/#/)

This project was created using React, Redux, JavaScript, HTML, Rails, and PostgreSQL.
